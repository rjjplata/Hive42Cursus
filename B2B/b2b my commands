Difference of Rocky and DebianOS
Rocky:
	- Rocky is more stable than debian and supports enterprise application
	- Does not have an upgrade path
	- It comes with many security  in-built features that helps protect from cyber attacks.
	
Debian:
	-Released and supported by community and members still maintain it
	-Has more software/packages available
	-Comes with easy installation package

Purpose of VM:
	The main purpose is to operate multiple operating systems at the same time, from the same piece of hardware. Without virtualization, operating multiple systems, it would require two separate physical units

Difference of aptitude and apt:
	Apt and Aptitude are both package managers but aptitude is more upgraded than apt. Apt is a low level package manager while Aptitude is a higher level package manager.
	In terms of upgrading, apt does upgrade most important packages and leaves the least important ones.
	Aptitude adds user interface that allows user to interactively search for a package and install or remove it.
	
What is AppArmor:
	AppArmor provides Mandatory Access Control security. For example an application can take photos by accesing the camera application, but then the administrator denies the privilege, so the application will not be able to access the camera application. If a vulnerability occurs, AppArmor blocks the application so that the damage does not spread to the rest of the system.
